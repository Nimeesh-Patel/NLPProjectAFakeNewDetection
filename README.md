# News Classification Project

## Course
**NLP (Semester 6)** - Pillai College of Engineering

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The project focuses on **News Classification**, where we apply various **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Language Models** to categorize news articles into predefined categories. This project involves exploring techniques like:
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model training
- Evaluating the models for their effectiveness in classifying news articles.
